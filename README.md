# LimeSurvey-RegDomainRestricter

A Plugin for LimeSurvey


This plugin lets you restrict public sign-up to specific domains. Great for restricting signup to only email@staff.domain.com or email@student.domain.com, etc.

## Installation

To install this plugin to LimeSurvey, download this repo as a zip and then extract it. Create a folder under `limeSurvey/plugins` called RegDomainRestricter and then upload `RegDomainRestricter.php` to that folder.

Thats all :)
